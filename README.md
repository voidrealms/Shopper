# shopper

React-Native Shopping App <br>
My first reach native application. Uses Redux and Persist <br>
<br>
Redux: http://redux.js.org/<br>
Persist: https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist<br>
Based on: http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/react_redux<br>
<br>
Uses the ScrollView, I want to figure out how to use FlatList or ListView with Redux
